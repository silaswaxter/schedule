"If you don't control your time, your time controls you." Time-blocking is a way
for me to plan and track where I spend my time. Its not perfect but its better
than not trying. 

This repository describes my daily schedule. The schedule is described in plain 
text files. The schedule data is transfered to gimp project files where layout 
takes place. Finally, these gimp files are exported and assembled into a 
booklet. I print, assemble, and carry this booklet with me.
